# Discrete Mathematics Self-Study ‚Äî Kenneth H. Rosen
Self-study of Discrete Mathematics (Rosen) with solved problems, structured notes, and practical mini-projects to prepare for CS graduate school.

This repository documents my in-depth self-study of **Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications** by Kenneth H. Rosen. My goal is to:

- Strengthen my mathematical foundation in preparation for a Master's in Computer Science.
- Solve a wide variety of problems to reinforce concepts.
- Build small interactive tools to apply each concept practically.
- Track and demonstrate clear evidence of continuous progress.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Study Strategy

For each chapter, I include:

- **Structured notes**: Definitions, theorems, examples, visuals
- **Solved problems**: Step-by-step reasoning for selected exercises
- **Reflections**: Insights, struggles, and connections to CS
- **Mini-projects**: Practical applications of the concepts in code (JavaScript/Python)
- **Progress tracking**: A checklist of completed topics

## üîç Purpose

I did not formally study discrete math during my undergraduate IT degree. This study bridges that gap and helps me build a rigorous base for graduate-level computer science, especially in areas like:

- Algorithms and complexity
- Logic and computation
- Graph theory and networks
- Cryptography and security
